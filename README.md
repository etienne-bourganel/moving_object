# Simulation

The moving object project is a simple simulation of a moving object on a board.

## How to run the simulation?

Run the file main.rb from the project folder in the bash console via the command 

```bash
$ruby main.rb
```

Follow the prompted instructions.

## Assumptions

1. User is asked to enter separately the width and height of the board
2. User is asked to enter separately intial x and y for moving object
3. The simulation ends as soon as last instruction makes the object fall off the board and prints [-1, -1]
4. If the simulation is successful, the printed results will be the coordinates of the moving object after the series of instructions
